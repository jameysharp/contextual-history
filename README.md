# Contextual History browser extension

Web browsers have always recorded the history of which pages you visit.
This browser extension takes that a step further by showing you which
links you followed when visiting those pages. With the Contextual
History sidebar open, you can see how you've gotten to the current page,
as well as where you've previously gone from here.

I think there's a lot more that an extension like this could do to
extract meaningful context from individual browsing history. Pages which
a person visited through a short chain of links are often closely
related to a single task which that person was working on, even if they
visited unrelated pages in between due to getting interrupted. Bookmarks
may identify graph roots and give more hints to the significance of a
group of pages for this person.
